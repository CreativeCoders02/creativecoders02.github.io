# Viman: Cloakroom Management Platform ðŸ§³

**Viman** is a digital platform built to streamline cloakroom management at our college, which has over **16,000 students** across all batches. Previously, belongings were recorded manually in a physical register, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. Viman solves this with an efficient, multi-user **React application**.

## Features

- **Student Slot Requests**: Students can request a slot to safely store their belongings.
- **Staff Workflow Management**: Staff manage requests with a Kanban-style board, moving requests through statusesâ€”`Pending`, `In Progress`, and `Completed`.
- **Verification and Completion**: Staff verify belongings, including item details and uploaded images, before moving requests to `Completed`.
- **Efficient Queuing**: Once a request is marked `In Progress`, the next request automatically becomes eligible, ensuring seamless processing.
